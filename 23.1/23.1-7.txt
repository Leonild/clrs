Assume for the sake of contradiction that a subset of edges E'
connects all vertices and has a minimum total weight; assume that T' =
(V', E') is not a tree: if T' is not a tree, it has some cycle C; if
T' has a cycle C, an edge e could be removed while still connecting
V'; if e has a positive weight, T' cannot have a minimum total weight;
thus contradicting the assumption.

23.1-7.png shows a graph with a minimal set of real edges that is not
a tree.
