In order to convert a cycle into a spanning tree, remove an arbitrary
edge; if any edge but e be removed, remove e instead to achieve a
lesser or equal total weight.

Conversely, in building the tree from the bottom up; e would be
rejected as a light edge in every cut, until it is the last
unincorporated edge: at which point the spanning tree is complete.
