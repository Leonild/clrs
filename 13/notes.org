  - binary tree with color (two-way coloring)
  - red-black constraint ensures that no path is more than twice as
    long as any other: balanced.
  - red-black properties:
    1. every node red or black
    2. root: black
    3. every leaf (nil): black
    4. if a node is red: both children are black
    5. all path from a node to leaves contain the same number of black nodes.
  - single sentinel represents =nil=.
  - black height: black nodes on any path from, but not including,
    node x.
  - red-black tree with n internal nodes has height at most $2\lg(n + 1)$
  - subtree rooted at x contains at least $2^{bh(k)} - 1$ internal
    nodes.
  - black-height of root at least $h/2$; thus: $n \geq 2^{h/2} - 1$

    $h \geq 2\lg(n + 1)$; how does h relate to bh, though?

    red-black trees ensure that no such path is more than twice as
    long as any other. (275)
    #+END_QUOTE
    moreover:
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    consequently, the black-height of the root must be at least
    $h/2$. (276)
    #+END_QUOTE
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    according to property 4, at least half the nodes on any simple
    path from the root to a leaf, not including tho root, must be
    black. (274)
    #+END_QUOTE
    $n \geq 2^{bh(x)} - 1$; $bh(x) \geq h/2$; $n \geq 2^{bh(x)} - 1
    \geq 2^{h/2} - 1$. Where $bh(x) = k$, the smallest number gives
    itself immediately:
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    $n \geq 2^k - 1$
    #+END_QUOTE
    "internal nodes," by the way, are the non-nil nodes from root to
    leaf (excluding leaves).

    the largest red-black tree of a $bh = k$ is one in which the rows
    alternate black-red (proof?): the only way to expand such a tree
    would be to add a black node, contradicting $bh = k$. such a tree
    has $2^h - 1$ = $2^{2k} - 1$ internal nodes (need to be able to
    derive this stuff ourselves); therefore:

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    $2^k - 1 \leq n \leq 2^{2k} - 1$
    #+END_QUOTE
