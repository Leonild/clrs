* TODO TODOs
  let's take the TODOs out of the notes into the TODO file? nah, it's
  compact; and if we really want to publish, we're going to have to go
  over all this again, anyway, with a fine-tooth comb.
* TODO pre-order-key-color-list->tree
* DONE tree-structures
  CLOSED: [2010-08-31 Tue 19:13]
  let's have a node structure that also stands for trees if it happens
  to be a root; we'll have to have a singular red-black-nil
  (sentinel), though, unless the tree-structure-cum-root-node happens
  to have its own nil. nah, let's just go singular.
* TODO tests
  we still have to find a place to store the tests (they're currently
  just inline within the implementation section)
