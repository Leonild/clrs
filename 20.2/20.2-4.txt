               McGee heap (worst case)
make-heap      Theta(1)
insert         O(lg n)
minimum        O(lg n)
extract-min    Theta(lg n)
union          O(lg n)
decrease-key   Theta(lg n)
delete         Theta(lg n)

McGee heaps are indistinguishable from binomial heaps in that they
refrain from deferring the difficult work of restructuring to delete
and extract-min.
