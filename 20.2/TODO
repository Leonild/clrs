Heaps should instead to a node-key parameter which is a key-accessor
of the arbitrary datum attached to the node; static keys already
burned me in the ass with Prim's: I have to call a set-prim-datum-key!
and fibonacci-heap-decrease-key!; if it were keyed on the datum with
an accessor, one call to set-prim-datum-key! would suffice.
