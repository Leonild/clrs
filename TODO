Generate dot -> png, bib -> bbl and tex -> pdf from a base Makefile
with well-composed generics.

8.3: radix-sort needs generalizing to other bases, cardinalities.

9: weighted-median-with-select is showing indeterminacy.

9.2: randomized-select-iter is defective.

9.3-3: Since fixing partition-median!, balanced-quicksort! is
     defective.

9-3: involves calling select for statistics above n/2 and a complex
   compare-and-exchange thereunder.

10.3-5: solution needs a correctness-argument; I suspect it's flawed.

10.4-2: Wasn't there a tree-map from SICP sans mutation? Similarly for
      tree-map/iter, with the exception of push!, pop!;
      unbounded-tree-map, for that matter.

11.3-3,5,6

11.4-3,5

11.5-1

11-1,2,3,4

12.1-3: accomplished the "easy" stack solution; but what about the
      "complicated but elegant" pointer-equivalence solution?

16.6-1 is defective (extra activity artifact)
