Generate dot -> png, bib -> bbl and tex -> pdf from a base Makefile
with well-composed generics.

Satellite data can be harvested by means of KEY (see srfi 95); ad hoc
data structures are superfluous. KEY default to, say, VALUES or other
identity mapping.

Each solution could probably use a description in addition to the
code.

6.5-8 need a heap with satellite data

8.3 radix-sort needs generalizing to other bases, cardinalities.

9 weighted-median-with-select is showing indeterminacy.

9.2 randomized-select-iter is defective.

9.3-3 Since fixing partition-median!, balanced-quicksort! is
     defective.

9-3 involves calling select for statistics above n/2 and a complex
   compare-and-exchange thereunder.

10.3-5 solution needs a correctness-argument; I suspect it's flawed.

10.4-2 Wasn't there a tree-map from SICP sans mutation? Similarly for
      tree-map/iter, with the exception of push!, pop!;
      unbounded-tree-map, for that matter.

10-2,3

11.2-5

11.3-3,5,6

11.4-3,5

11.5-1

11-1,2,3,4

12.1-3 accomplished the "easy" stack solution; but what about the
      "complicated but elegant" pointer-equivalence solution?

15.4-6

15.5-4

15.6-1 is defective (extra activity artifact)

15.6-3 there is a known O(n lg n) solution

15.6-4 overlaps with fewest activities
