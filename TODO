Facienda (things to do)

  Facienda are incomplete.

  Facta belong in ChangeLog.

  8.3: radix-sort needs generalizing to other bases, cardinalities.

  9: weighted-median-with-select is showing indeterminacy.

  9.2: randomized-select-iter is defective.

  9.3-3: Since fixing partition-median!, balanced-quicksort! is
         defective.

  9-3: involves calling select for statistics above n/2 and a complex
       compare-and-exchange thereunder.

  10.3-5: solution needs a correctness-argument; I suspect it's flawed.

  10.4-2: Wasn't there a tree-map from SICP sans mutation? Similarly for
          tree-map/iter, with the exception of push!, pop!;
          unbounded-tree-map, for that matter.

Facta (things done)

  Standardize on chapter sections, not problems.
