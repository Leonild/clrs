\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item $\{(2,1), (3,1), (8,6), (8,1), (6,1)\}$
\item $\{n,n-1,\dots,2,1\}$
  \begin{align}
    \sum_{i=1}^ni&=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\
    &=\Theta(n^2)
  \end{align}
\item Insertion sort works by inverting up to $i - 1$ pairs for every
  $a_i \in A$; and therefore has $\Theta(n^2)$ complexity.
\item See \texttt{inversions.scm} and \texttt{2-4.scm}; it works by
  counting all merged elements where $L[i] > R[j]$. After the merge,
  the elements will be in order and thus not counted twice; if there
  is a $L[i] > R[j]$ which was not counted, we would have incremented
  the right counter not the left: resulting in a contradiction.
\end{enumerate}
