If the case where x is y's left child: for there to be a key smaller
than y but larger than x, it must appear in y's left subtree; but x is
y's whole subtree.

# On branch master
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#
#	modified:   12.2-9.txt
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	.#12.2-9.txt
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
Similarly, for y's right child: any key smaller than x but larger than
y must either violate y's parent-status of x's leaf-status.
