inorder-tree-walk, which runs in Theta(n), effectively does the same
thing by exhausting the left subtree to attain min; and discovering
successors by minimizing right subtrees, or ascending to first-right
parents thanks to the recursive stack.

The procedures are equivalent and both run in Theta(n).
