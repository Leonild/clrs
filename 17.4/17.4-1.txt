Since there is an exponential relationship betteen the load factor and
expected number of probes; expanding the table early (while alpha < 1)
would be economical.

If c is the multiplying factor of expansion, the table size should be
increasing when the difference between 1/(1 - alpha) and 1/(1 -
alpha/c) will pay for copying the table.

The expected number of probes approaches n as the expected number of
probes increases.
