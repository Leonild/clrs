;;; Each hall is optimally scheduled f√ºr sich, or we could fix it so
;;; that it is; as such, each hall has a maximum subset of
;;; activities. Since activities are maximized across halls, the
;;; cardinality of halls is minimized; otherwise, we could propose an
;;; optimal solution that minimized rooms.

;;; The result is a suboptimal Theta(n^2) algorithm that may use more
;;; rooms than necessary; see e.g. {[1, 4), [2, 5), [6, 7), [4, 8)}.
;;; O(n lg n) is possible, and more difficult.
